Advancement-> In this code version, we have 2 HTML files->
1-> index.html :- Main Front End File.
2-> output.html:- Normal Front End File, which is used to display the output.

Here we added input restriction like Age can be in range (18-100) only, credit score can be in range (0-1000) only, No. of Products in range (0-10) only.
& added some background images into both the html pages & formated the colours of pages.
